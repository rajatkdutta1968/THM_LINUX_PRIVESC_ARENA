Privilege Escalation using NFS Share
=====================================

Some Conception:

NFS is a Network File Sharing protocol that allows users to share directories and files over the network across different operating systems.
It will enable remote systems to be accessible locally when the shares are mounted.
** The accessibility of the NFS shares is based on whatever privileges are assigned to the share. **


 



# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
#               to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
#
# Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
# /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
# Example for NFSv4:
# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
# /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
#

/tmp *(rw,sync,insecure,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)

#/tmp *(rw,sync,insecure,no_subtree_check)
